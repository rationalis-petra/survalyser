<h1>Analysis</h1>
<p>
  Survalyser can analyse data in two ways: it can
  produce Kaplan-Meier curves and perform cox regression.
  You'll see this reflected in the 'analyse' column (left of
  the spreadsheet view), which has both of these options.
</p>

<h2>Kaplan-Meier</h2>
<p>To make a Kaplan-Meier plot, you'll need to select three
columns:
<ul>
<li><b>Time</b>: This column must be numeric (i.e. no dates etc), and
represents the time until a patient died or was censored.
</li>
<li><b>Event</b>: This column must be boolean (i.e. True/False), and
will be True if the Patient Died and False if they were Censored.
</li>
<li><b>Category</b>: This column can contain anything, but usually
will be text (e.g. "Luminal A", "Luminal B", ...). Each unique value
in this column will correspond to a single curve on the plot.
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Cox Regression</h2>
