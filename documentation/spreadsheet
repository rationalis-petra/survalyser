<h1>The Spreadsheet </h1>

<p>
The spreadsheet view will open once you have loaded data into
Survalyser. Unlike excel, you cannot edit the contents of spreadsheet
cells. However, there are some pre-processing actions you can take
before analysing the data here. Notably, you can <b>filter</b>
and <b>generate</b>
</p>

<h3>Filtering</h3>
<p>
You can filter out rows based on the values in a specific
column. To do this, you can click on the 'filter' button, which
is next to the home button on the toolbar. This will bring up
a pop-up window allowing you to filter out values based on that
column. 
</p>

<p>
For example, if I have an AGE column, and I want to
filter out all patients who are under 50, I open
the filter menu:
</p>
<p>TODO: IMAGE</p>
<p>
From here, I can select my comparison type to be "<",
and I input the value 50. Finally, I click 'filter'.
This will filter out all rows with patients under 50.
<p>TODO: IMAGE</p>

<h3>Generating</h3>
Sometimes, you might want to generate a new column. This will usually
be one of the 3 columns used in the analysis, i.e. the time, event and
category columns. 


<h4>Time</h4>
Preferably, you already have a time column, but it may be the case that
you want to calculate the time between two dates.

<h4>Event</h4>
<p>
The 'event' column will determine whether or not a patient is censored.
If you do not have one already, Survalyser can generate one for you.
This functions very similarly to the filtering, but I'll go through
an example to demonstrate.

<p>
Most commonly, there will be a cause of death column, so we'll say
that we want a 
</p>

<h4>Category</h4>


<h2>Advanced</h2>
<p>
  The spreadsheet facilities, while simple, are designed to cover most
  common use-cases. If you find them to be insufficient for your task,
  your best option is to process the data in a seperate program before
  importing it into Survalyser. Nevertheless, survalyser does have support
  for advanced filtering and column generation, which you'll notice
  under the 'advanced' tab. You should only use this option if you are
  familiar with the python language.
</p>

<h3>Filtering</h3>
  If you select 'advanced filtering', you will be provided with a text
  area which contains the following code:
<p>
def predicate(row):
    
</p>
  Here, you must write a python function that will take in a row, 
  and return either True or False. When you are done, click 'run'.
  Survalyser is based on pandas and numpy, so the rows that you
  are being passed in will be rows from a pandas dataframe which
  represents the spreadsheet.

<h3>Generation</h3>
<p>
  You can also generate new rows using python. The 'advanced' generator
  is much the same as the advanced filter. This time, however, the function
  you provide must take in a row and output a value that will be inserted
  into a cell in the dataframe. The function is called 'generate':
</p>
<p>
def generate(row):
  ...
</p>
